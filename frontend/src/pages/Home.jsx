        The <b>Memory Palace</b> technique helps you memorize information by 
        associating it with familiar locations. By visualizing facts along 
        well-known places in your mind, recall becomes easier and faster.

      <p className="max-w-2xl text-lg mb-6">
        Choosing locations you know well makes it easier to mentally navigate 
        through your palace. Each spot can represent a fact, image, or concept.
